# AtlasForge Robotics

AtlasForge Robotics is an open, modular AI robotics stack for real robots and simulators. It blends autonomy, perception, and policy learning into a coherent pipeline with a strong emphasis on reproducibility and cross-platform support. The system is inspired by best practices from open autonomy stacks and robotics research, but it is built as a clean, extensible Python-first platform.

## Goals
- Provide a unified API for perception, planning, control, and policy learning.
- Make it easy to swap between real hardware and simulation backends.
- Support dataset-driven workflows, offline training, and on-robot evaluation.
- Ship with clear interfaces that enable custom robot adapters and sensors.

## Core Components
- **Core Runtime**: deterministic execution loops, data logging, and safety checks.
- **Perception & Mapping**: 2D/3D pipelines, sensor fusion, and map builders.
- **Planning & Control**: navigation, trajectory generation, and low-level control.
- **Policy Learning**: imitation + RL pipelines and replayable datasets.
- **Simulation Bridges**: adapters for ROS 2 + Gazebo, Isaac Sim, AirSim, and custom sims.

## Quick Start (placeholder)
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
